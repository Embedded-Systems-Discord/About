# About
This GitHub organization is where all the community projects from the Internet Of Things discord server live. The projects are voted on by the community and the project that get the most votes gets a repo created. Anyone can create a branch of the project and make changes. They can then submit a pull request to add their changes to the main branch. When a project is created a set of goals will be created for the project once the goals are met the project is finished and we will vote on a new project to start. Once a project is finnished it will stay open for the community to continue to improve if they wish.
