# About
This GitHub organization is where all the community projects from the Internet Of Things discord server live. The project that is voted on by the community will get a repo created. Anyone can create a branch of the project and make changes. They can then submit a pull request to add their changes to the main branch. When a project is selected a set of goals will be created for the project. Once the goals are met the project is finished and we will vote on a new project to start. Once a project is finished it will stay open for the community to continue to improve if they wish.

# Project Ideas
